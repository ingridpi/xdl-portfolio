I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Riaz Ahmad, for his guidance and support throughout this project. I would also like to thank my Master's colleagues for being there during this journey and the valuable discussions we had.

I would like to convey my appreciation to my partner for his unwavering support and all the help in reviewing the code and the report. I would also like to acknowledge my family's continuous support and encouragement throughout my studies.
