\chapter{Results} \label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the results of conducting experiments under the methodology proposed in Chapter \ref{ch:methodology}. The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the implemented \acrshort{drl} models for portfolio optimisation in changing environment representations and market conditions. Moreover, to analyse the interpretability of the model's decisions, a framework using post-hoc explainability techniques is outlined.

\section{Dataset} \label{sec:dataset}

Given the general difficulty in finding the appropriate \acrshort{drl} algorithm with a suitable \gls{rewardfunction} for portfolio optimisation, the five implemented algorithms were tested on five different datasets. Each dataset consists of a different set of financial assets, ranging from three different asset classes. First, three datasets were constructed using the stock constituents of three renowned indexes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \acrfull{djia} with 30 stocks,
    \item \acrfull{eurostoxx50} with 50 stocks,
    \item \acrfull{ftse100} with 100 stocks.
\end{itemize}

The constituents of each of the indexes were retrieved in April 2025 and can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:datasets-equities}. It is important to note that the datasets were chosen to illustrate different currencies, as this introduces another factor of changing market conditions. 

Additionally, two datasets were constructed using commodities and currencies, respectively. The commodities dataset includes six different commodities, which are listed in Appendix \ref{sec:datasets-commodities}. These are a sample of the most traded commodities in the market and were chosen by their availability in the \texttt{Yahoo! Finance API} \footnote{https://uk.finance.yahoo.com}. With regards to the currencies dataset, it includes ten different currency pairs, listed in Appendix \ref{sec:datasets-currencies}. The currency pairs were selected based on their trading volume and liquidity, with all pairs having \acrfull{usd} as the quote currency.
