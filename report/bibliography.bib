   abstract = {In the era of big data, deep learning for predicting stock market prices and trends has become even more popular than before. We collected 2 years of data from Chinese stock market and proposed a comprehensive customization of feature engineering and deep learning-based model for predicting price trend of stock markets. The proposed solution is comprehensive as it includes pre-processing of the stock market dataset, utilization of multiple feature engineering techniques, combined with a customized deep learning based system for stock market price trend prediction. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on frequently used machine learning models and conclude that our proposed solution outperforms due to the comprehensive feature engineering that we built. The system achieves overall high accuracy for stock market trend prediction. With the detailed design and evaluation of prediction term lengths, feature engineering, and data pre-processing methods, this work contributes to the stock analysis research community both in the financial and technical domains.},

   abstract = {Algorithmic trading is a continuous perception and decision making problem, where environment perception requires to learn feature representation from highly non-stationary and noisy financial time series, and decision making requires the algorithm to explore the environment and simultaneously make correct decisions in an online manner without any supervised information. To address these two problems, we propose a time-driven feature-aware jointly deep reinforcement learning model (TFJ-DRL) that integrates deep learning model and reinforcement learning model to improve the financial signal representation learning and action decision making in algorithmic trading. Concretely, we learn the environmental representation by adaptively selecting and re-weighting various features of financial signals and summarize the attention values between historical information and changing trend depending on the current state. Besides, the supervised deep learning and reinforcement learning are jointly and iteratively trained to make full use of the supervised signals in the training data, and obtain more update information and stricter loss function constraints, thereby increasing investment returns. TFJ-DRL is evaluated on real-world financial data with different price trends (rising, falling and no obvious direction). A series of analysis show the robust superiority and the extensive applicability of the proposed method.},

   abstract = {In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm has been widely used in algorithmic trading. Many fully automated trading systems or strategies have been built using DRL agents, which integrate price prediction and trading signal generation in one system. However, the previous agents extract the current state from the market data without considering the long-term market historical trend when making decisions. Besides, plenty of related and useful information has not been considered. To address these two problems, we propose a novel model named Parallel Multi-Module Deep Reinforcement Learning (PMMRL) algorithm. Here, two parallel modules are used to extract and encode the feature: one module employing Fully Connected (FC) layers is used to learn the current state from the market data of the traded stock and the fundamental data of the issuing company; another module using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers aims to detect the long-term historical trend of the market. The proposed model can extract features from the whole environment by the above two modules simultaneously, taking the advantages of both LSTM and FC layers. Extensive experiments on China stock market illustrate that the proposed PMMRL algorithm achieves a higher profit and a lower drawdown than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Specifically, a forecasting model is developed using blended ensemble learning that combines various machine learning methods, including k-nearest neighbour regression, regression trees, linear regression, ridge regression, and support vector regression. Data for Brent and WTI crude oil prices at various time series frequencies are used to validate the proposed blending ensemble learning approach. To show the validity of the proposed model, its performance is further benchmarked against existing individual and ensemble learning methods used for predicting crude oil price, such as lasso regression, bagging lasso regression, boosting, random forest, and support vector regression. We demonstrate that our proposed blending-based model dominates the existing forecasting models in terms of forecasting errors for both short- and medium-term horizons.},

Investment wealth management refers to the use of funds by investors to arrange funds reasonably, for example, savings, bank financial products, bonds, stocks, commodity spots, real estate, gold, art, and many others. Wealth management tools manage and assign families, individuals, enterprises, and institutions to achieve the purpose of increasing and maintaining value to accelerate asset growth. Among them, in investment and financial management, people’s favorite product of investment often stocks, because the stock market has great advantages and charm, especially compared with other investment methods. More and more scholars have developed methods of prediction from multiple angles for the stock market. According to the feature of financial time series and the task of price prediction, this article proposes a new framework structure to achieve a more accurate prediction of the stock price, which combines Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long–Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). This new method is aptly named stock sequence array convolutional LSTM (SACLSTM). It constructs a sequence array of historical data and its leading indicators (options and futures), and uses the array as the input image of the CNN framework, and extracts certain feature vectors through the convolutional layer and the layer of pooling, and as the input vector of LSTM, and takes ten stocks in U.S.A and Taiwan as the experimental data. Compared with previous methods, the prediction performance of the proposed algorithm in this article leads to better results when compared directly.},

   abstract = {Stock-market prediction using machine-learning technique aims at developing effective and efficient models that can provide a better and higher rate of prediction accuracy. Numerous ensemble regressors and classifiers have been applied in stock market predictions, using different combination techniques. However, three precarious issues come in mind when constructing ensemble classifiers and regressors. The first concerns with the choice of base regressor or classifier technique adopted. The second concerns the combination techniques used to assemble multiple regressors or classifiers and the third concerns with the quantum of regressors or classifiers to be ensembled. Subsequently, the number of relevant studies scrutinising these previously mentioned concerns are limited. In this study, we performed an extensive comparative analysis of ensemble techniques such as boosting, bagging, blending and super learners (stacking). Using Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN), we constructed twenty-five (25) different ensembled regressors and classifiers. We compared their execution times, accuracy, and error metrics over stock-data from Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE), Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE-SENSEX) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), from January 2012 to December 2018. The study outcome shows that stacking and blending ensemble techniques offer higher prediction accuracies (90–100%) and (85.7–100%) respectively, compared with that of bagging (53–97.78%) and boosting (52.7–96.32%). Furthermore, the root means square error (RMSE) recorded by stacking (0.0001–0.001) and blending (0.002–0.01) shows a better fit of ensemble classifiers and regressors based on these two techniques in market analyses compared with bagging (0.01–0.11) and boosting (0.01–0.443). Finally, the results undoubtedly suggest that an innovative study in the domain of stock market direction prediction ought to include ensemble techniques in their sets of algorithms.},

However, it is challenging to understand a DRL-based trading strategy because of the black-box nature of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents for the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as the reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing actual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a linear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL agents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are the coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model. Thirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and multi-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by calculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent and the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods. Finally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent stocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021. Our approach empirically reveals that a DRL agent exhibits a stronger multi-step prediction power than machine learning methods.},

The ensemble strategy inherits and integrates the best features of the three algorithms, thereby robustly adjusting to different market situations. In order to avoid the large memory consumption in training networks with continuous action space, we employ a load-on-demand technique for processing very large data.

In this approach, investment decision making is viewed as a stochastic control problem, and strategies are discovered directly. We present an adaptive algorithm called recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) for discovering investment policies. The need to build forecasting models is eliminated, and better trading performance is obtained. The direct reinforcement approach differs from dynamic programming and reinforcement algorithms such as TD-learning and Q-learning, which attempt to estimate a value function for the control problem. We find that the RRL direct reinforcement framework enables a simpler problem representation, avoids Bellman's curse of dimensionality and offers compelling advantages in efficiency. We demonstrate how direct reinforcement can be used to optimize risk-adjusted investment returns (including the differential Sharpe ratio), while accounting for the effects of transaction costs. In extensive simulation work using real financial data, we find that our approach based on RRL produces better trading strategies than systems utilizing Q-Learning (a value function method). Real-world applications include an intra-daily currency trader and a monthly asset allocation system for the S&P 500 Stock Index and T-Bills.},

For this to occur, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of AI techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI. Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the existing literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is sought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This literature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to XAI with a reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

We investigate the capability of local strategies and global strategies coming from cooperative game theory to explain the trained neural networks, and we find that global strategies such as Shapley values can be effectively used in practice.

We apply Shapley values and the Python library SHAP to a real credit risk database and show that the two available SHAP types (interventional and path-dependent) provide very similar results even under correlated features. The main drawback of SHAP is that it is not portfolio invariant, this is, the explanation for the prediction provided for each observation depends on the portfolio distribution of the features. This can be a serious problem for customers and banking regulators, who expect that explanations will stay stable as long as the clients characteristics do not change. We conduct several tests and show that the SHAP explanation of an observation may considerably change depending on the rest of the portfolio distribution. As a consequence, the explanation of a client may vary over time even if her characteristics do not change and banks using the same model (for ex. commercial models) may provide different explanations to the same client.},

Nevertheless, it is not widely recognized that both Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity collapse into Mean Variance under some conditions, which implies that a universal solution to the portfolio optimization problem could potentially exist. In fact, the process of sequential computation of optimal component weights that maximize the portfolio's expected return subject to a certain risk budget can be reformulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and hence as a stochastic optimal control, where the system being controlled is a portfolio consisting of multiple investment components, and the control is its component weights. Consequently, the problem could be solved using model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) without knowing specific component dynamics. By examining existing methods of both value-based and policy-based model-free RL for the portfolio optimization problem, we identify some of the key unresolved questions and difficulties facing today's portfolio managers of applying model-free RL to their investment portfolios.},
