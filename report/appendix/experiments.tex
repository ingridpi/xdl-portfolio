\chapter{Experiment Results}

In this Appendix, the results of the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the implemented algorithms under changing conditions are presented. Only the tables that do not fit in the main Results chapter \ref{ch:results} are included here.

\section{Experiment: Algorithm Comparison} \label{app:experiment_algorithms_comparison}

The following tables summarise the results of the algorithm comparison experiment conducted on the 5 datasets with \acrshort{ohlcv} prices as the environment representation. The results for the \acrshort{a2c} algorithm are presented in Table \ref{tab:experiment_algorithms_a2c} in Section \ref{sec:exp-algorithm-comparison}, whereas for the \acrshort{ppo}, \acrshort{ddpg}, \acrshort{td3} and \acrshort{sac} algorithms, the results are presented in the following tables.

\input{tables/experiment_algorithms_ddpg.tex}

\input{tables/experiment_algorithms_td3.tex}

\input{tables/experiment_algorithms_sac.tex}

\section{Experiment: Environment Representation} \label{app:experiment_environment_representation}

The table \ref{tab:experiment_environment_cumulative} summarises the performance, according to the cumulative return, of the five algorithms in the four possible different environment representations: \acrshort{ohlcv} prices, \acrshort{ohlcv} prices with indicators, \acrshort{ohlcv} prices with covariance, and \acrshort{ohlcv} prices with indicators and covariance. The results are presented for three datasets: DowJones30, Commodities, and Currencies.
